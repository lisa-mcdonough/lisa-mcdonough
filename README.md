# 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa McDonough

I turn raw data into clear, purposeful stories using Power BI, DAX, and (soon) Python.

With a background in data extraction, API integration, and business insight creation, I build dashboards that go beyond the numbers—they communicate. Whether I’m shaping metrics from a CRM pipeline or modeling bakery sales in Power BI, my focus is always the same: make it *useful*, make it *understandable*, make it *impactful*.

- 🔌 Connect and wrangle data via APIs (Clover, Lightspeed, etc.)  
- 🎬 Create video walkthroughs to explain and showcase insights  
- 🖊️ PowerPoint presentations with fully interactive embedded Power-BI reports
- 🛠️ Continuously level up (currently exploring Python for analytics)

## ✨ A Bit More About Me

- 🎽 I approach analytics with the same persistence and rhythm I apply to learning and building.  
- 🧠 I’m drawn to the tools and techniques that make data speak—APIs, wildcards, narrative frameworks, and anything that sharpens communication. 
- 🛠️ My GitHub is where I build, polish, and share ideas that grow into real-world skills

Thanks for stopping by. Let’s build something meaningful.
